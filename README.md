# Moyai a Discord bot

Hello, 

A lot has changed with this version of Moyai, so I will explain what all has changed. 

The following below has changed:

- Console Interface - 

When launching the program, you will notice the following: 
  Prints the extension _cog file_ being loaded into the program
  Prints the platform _operating system_ the program is being ran on 
  Prints the version of the program
  Prints the client ID
  Prints how many servers the bot resides in

- New Commands - 

The following commands added: 
  ;ping - Ping an IP or DNS.
  ;google - Google Search
  ;urban - Search through the Urban Dictionary

- New Files - 

When looking a the directory of the program, you will notice the following new files: 
  config.py - Replaces the .json file used for the bot. 
  setup.py - Creates the config.py file and automatically installs the requiste modules needed to run the program. 
  Requirements.txt - A text file that setup.py pulls to install the requiste modules. 

The setup.py should be an automatic process with no errors. However, if the file does not install all the requiste files, contact Discord: OverdarkGOD#8542 and
I will fix the issue.
